# Portfolio-Site
Personal static site

This is my portfolio-site that aims to show the most important information about my programming journey so far. I started it from a ready to use raw template and added the whole personal content which represents me. At first I did not plan to upload it but I got impressed by the final results and decided to make it an actual static site. In case you are curious, you can take a look at the site here: https://portfolio-site-jp1.pages.dev/
